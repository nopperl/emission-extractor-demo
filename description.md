Upload (or link to an URL of) a sustainability report PDF and get the most recent scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions reported in the document. Since this space does not use a GPU, the process will take quite a while (at least an hour, drastically longer for more complex reports). The system was developed for English documents.

Notes about the output: the emission values are in metric tons of CO2eq. The `sources` field is a list of pages containing the emission values. The page numbers are 0-based, e.g. the number 12 will correspond to page number 13 in your PDF viewer.
